Here is a list of trading goals that I wish to accomplish. You can view my progress here.

░ Enter trades on pullbacks<br/>
░ Sell premium when IV is high (above 50%)<br/>
✓ Enter contrarian trades based off overbought/oversold stochastic indicators, and support/resistance levels<br/>
░ Sell strangles, not ICs, on indices when IV is high (Can sell ICs on individual stocks)
✓ Avoid trading biotechs and FANG naked<br/>
✓ Sell iron condors that collect about 1/3 the width of the strikes<br/>
