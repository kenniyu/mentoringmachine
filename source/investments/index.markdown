Here is a list of trading goals that I wish to accomplish. You can view my progress here.

░ Enter trades on pullbacks
░ Sell premium when IV is high (above 50%)
░ Enter contrarian trades based off overbought/oversold stochastic indicators, and support/resistance levels
✓ Avoid trading biotechs and FANG naked
✓ Sell iron condors that collect about 1/3 the width of the strikes
