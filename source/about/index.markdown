This is a blog that tracks my progress with the goals that I want to achieve in three different aspects of my life: career, health, and investments. You will notice that many things here explore ways to psychologically induce myself to become a change agent, ultimately creating behaviors which lead me closer to my goals. 

You'll be able to follow along with my daily blog posts, which I use as a way of journaling my progress. 

You'll also be able to see my ongoing behavioral changes in each page in the navigation items above. For reference, here is a legend of what the markings mean.

Untouched behavioral changes are left marked with empty squares □<br/>
Ongoing behavioral changes are marked with shaded squares ░<br/>
"Accomplished" behavioral changes are marked with checkmarks ✓<br/>

"Accomplished" is vague. To deem a behavior as accomplished, my behavior on average over the past 2 weeks should be inline with the description to at least a 90% accuracy (practicality assumes room for "cheat" days or slips).

Feel free to filter my blog posts by any of the three aspects at the bottom of the page.
