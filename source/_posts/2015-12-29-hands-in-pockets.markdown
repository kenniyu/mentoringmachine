Today, I honestly did not even place a new trade. My hands were in my pockets the entire time.

An exit order did fill, it was for the DIA IC, exited at 50% of max profit. Good. These GTC orders are getting filled effortlessly.

Was today a profitable day? No. Did I feel good about my trades? Yes, because I did not place any. I've already sold some OOM calls on this overbought stochastic reading, and, because I'm not going to add more negative deltas, I'm just going to sit and wait for the next drop. At that point, I'll probably lower my delta exposure. For now, not much I can do anyway. I won't even sell puts to flatten those deltas because it's not worth it in a low IV environment. 

My honest opinion? Today's rally was the [idiots' rally](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-29/herd-heading-cliff "idiots' rally") of the week. Just saying.
