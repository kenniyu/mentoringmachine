Today I started my first day at Stellar. I would say I made decent progress so far - I thought it would take me a bit longer to get the codebase up and running, but I already have the environment setup and am already beginning to take a look at the code that I'll be working with. Score. Tomorrow, I'll dive deeper into the code, and will be recording what I find in a doc.

On the health side, today was an "off day," meaning no working out. For about the first month, no cardio with be incorporated into my fitness routines. This is just for me to retain the new behavioral changes more easily. Tomorrow, I'll be waking up early to hit the gym, so I'll need to review my plan later tonight and mentally prepare as well. As for tonight, I'll be eating the food I had cooked yesterday. 

On the investments front, not much happened today. I opened up an IC today on IWM, since it currently showed the highest IV rank out of the DIA, QQQ, IWM, and SPY. A trade was closed in P for a 50% profit, so I'll take that. Other than that, no opening trades today, which is nice. On a low volume day, and not much IV increase, I'll sit on my hands. We'll see how the market behaves tomorrow, but I do not expect volume to pick up either, nor any major market movement to occur, so I'll probably be sitting on my hands again.
