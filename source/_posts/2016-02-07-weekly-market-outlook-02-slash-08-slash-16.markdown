Here's the market outlook for this upcoming week.

I'll begin by looking at the broad market indices.

Here's the SPX:

2 weeks ago, the market consolidated in the range shown by the blue lines, and subsequently broke out of that to the upside by approximately 50 points. Generally, that's a bullish signal (when we break out of balance with such a strong move, the expected movement is a continuation). However, not only did we stall there the next day, but over this past week, we fell back down. Just this past Friday, we broke back into that balance area and *closed* the trading day on the lows of that balance area. This spells to me a bearish tone in magnitude greater than the bullish one we had last Friday (when we broke out of balance). The reason is that, when we broke out of balance to the upside, we expected the move to continue that way, but as James Dalton said, if what we expect to happen doesn't happen, then we should expect a hard movement in the other direction. 

Given all of that, I expect the SPX to continue its move downwards in the short term. I'm not ruling out the possibility of any rallies from here on out, but I think the probabilities are small, and even if we do rally, it should be a small bounce before we soon continue lower.

So where can we go from here? Let's zoom out and take a look at the bigger picture on the weekly SPX chart:

Assuming bearish pressure continues, we should be headed towards the ascending trendline support. In the next couple of weeks, that would be around the 1750 to the 1800 level. A possible trade idea here is setting up a fly around the target area to capture that premium drain about two weeks out. I've already set up a balanced fly expiring in February, 25 points wide, centered at 1760.

From that supporting trendline, we could see a bounce, so when we get there, I'll talk about the possible bounce plays. Until then, my target remains that trendline.

Let's also take a look at other indices.

Here's the weekly on the NDX:

Again, this spells bearish to me. We had two bullish hammers from 3 weeks ago, each of which insinuates a move higher, but instead, this past week, we erased all of that (buyer shutout) and closed even lower.

The same is true for the RUT:

[![RUT](/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly.png)](/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly.png)

Even clearer here, as it exhibits a prominent "bear flag" pattern.

Here's the DJX:

Which doesn't appear quite as bearish as the other 3 indices, but with the majority of the indices all looking very bearish, it won't be long before this index follows them as well.

Hope you enjoyed the weekly outlook, and even better if you take action. Good luck!
