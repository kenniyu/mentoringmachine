Here are a list of toxic trading assumptions, and ways to rethink the assumption as antidotes to improve my emotions:

1. A Good Day is a Winning Day

I should not determine a day as good/bad based on my P/L. A good day is one where I follow my trading rules, from execution to management. I should not be expecting to make profits every day. I should not expect to be happy if I have a profitable day, nor should I expect to be sad if I do not have a profitable day.

2. Success Means Making a Living from Trading

It's ridiculous to assume this. People who are experts in other areas spend years becoming such. For example, a doctor spends at least 8 years in school before becoming an expert. Similarly, actors spend years (probably starting from a young age) before they're able to perform. It's more realistic to expect to keep my losses at a minimum and improve my trading process. Expecting to make a living from trading right off the bat will lead me to frustration and failure.

So what are my expectations for my development over time?

- To enter trades on pullbacks, and *wait* if necessary. 
- To sell premium when IV is high (above 50%)
- To enter contrarian trades based off overbought/oversold stochastic indicators, and support/resistance levels
- To not trade biotechs and FANG naked
- To sell iron condors that collect about 1/3 the width of the strikes

These are all challenging, but realistic and attainable. Success if measured by achieving these expectations consistently (and not jumping the gun because I feel like I will be missing out). 

These will be on the investments page as well.
