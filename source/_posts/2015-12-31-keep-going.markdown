Last night before I fell asleep, I looked at the time and thought to myself, "there is no way that I would be able to wake up at 5 AM tomorrow." But I thought about the efforts I made so far, and frankly, it has not even been a week since I started this routine. Actually, I've only woken up at 5 AM once, and that was two days ago when I first started the routine. To stop now? How sad. Sleep now. 

Alarm rings 4:55. Cold air. Dry eyes. Suck it up. Drink water. Down shake. Hit the gym.

Complete Day A routine.

| Straight Bar Tricep Pushdown           | 30 (+5)      | 10 (+3)    | 8 (+1)     | 6 (+1)     | 

Feel good.

Now diet-wise. Need more tupperware. Let's do this next week.

What was good:

- Did not slip back into old habits. Got up and just hit the gym.

What to improve on:

- Watch the time and make sure I'm planning ahead to sleep earlier. 
- Get some tupperware for food prep
