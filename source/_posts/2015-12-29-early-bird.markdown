My chest needs more improvement, but there are a couple of factors affecting the target miss, such as the time of the day of the workout, and the fact that I haven't worked my chest since a week ago. Consistency will bring more accurate readings over time. For now, this is a start.

What was good: 

- maintained good focus
- ensured strict rest periods

What to improve on:

- taking a set to failure (legs, biceps)
