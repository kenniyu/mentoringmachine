The past week has been a huge tidal wave for my equity curve. 

I got emotional after finding out that my OOM naked puts on /ES were getting closer to being ITM, sold an /ES to neutralize some deltas, only to find that the market would rip higher the next day. Then I neutralized more deltas by selling more puts (putting on more size), only to see the market drop huge the next day, forcing me to sell another /ES to neutralize more deltas, only to see the market close above my cost basis for /ES.

Obviously, the problem wasn't in neutralizing deltas. It was putting on too much size at the beginning. Instead of starting with many naked puts on the /ES (many as in more than I was comfortable with), I should've kept it small, and probably should've bought a more OOM put to reduce risk and lower buying power requirement. 

It seems that I still have not learned. The goal of staying small has not yet been achieved. I will mark this as a top goal to achieve in my current investments goal page. I will keep this in check every day, before I place a trade.

Good luck to me next week. I should be good to the downside, and any upside will really bring in some premium.
