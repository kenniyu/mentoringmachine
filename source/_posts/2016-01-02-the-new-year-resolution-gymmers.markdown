I was honestly a bit scared when I headed to the gym this morning, but it turned out that most of the people I saw there looked like gym veterans. All jacked and everything. My bad.

Well here was my performance this time around

| Lift                                   | weight (lbs)| set 1 reps | set 2 reps | set 3 reps |
| ---------------------------------------|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Deadlift                               | 255         | 7          | 5          | 5          |
| Leg Curl                               | 90          | 7          | 5          | 3          |
| Flat Dumbbell Chest Press              | 85          | 7 (+2)     | 5 (+2)     | 2          |
| Inclined Dumbbell Chest Press          | 65          | 7          | 5 (+1)     | 2          |
| Cable Flyes                            | 20          | 7          | 5          | 5          |
| Preacher Curls                         | 80 (-5)     | 7          | 6          | 4          |
| Hammer Curls                           | 35 (+5)     | 7          | 4          | 2          |

So I took the preacher curls down 5 pounds, since the barbell was 80 pounds, not 85. 

For exercises in which the weight changed, I did not bother calculating the delta. 

Overall, not bad. I see some improvement. 

Press the advantage. Keep it up.
