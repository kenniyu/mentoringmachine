A lot of weekly puts are expiring this week for me. That'll bring in a ton of theta, but one thing I've been trying to do is to stay small. Any violent move to the upside or downside can dramatically wipe my account of profits gained from the previous week(s). With such a clean track record for the year so far, it'll be quite disappointing to see this happen. 

According to the ST, when the market is sold so much like what we've seen, we usually see a spike in volume, followed by a rally the following days. Interestingly, not that much volume traded today. This causes me to be a little doubtful of a rally tomorrow.

One of the things that I really like about ST is that they do directional plays, and they are really good at them. I've never seen someone to accurate with their trades, so one of the goals that I have currently is to follow some of their trades. I heard a good advice today that will help me pull the trigger, and that is, simply do the trade, but put on a small size. Worry about size later, but focus on staying small and following the entries and exits according to plan. So instead of an outright buying/selling of 1 /ES contract, maybe trade 250 shares of the SPY. Also, perhaps try paper-trading the XEL-CMS pairs trade. For some of their trade ideas, they have unlimited risk on jumbotrons, which isn't my style. I can reduce risk by making the trade a limited risk and perhaps paying a slight debit for the trade.

I'll update the investments page to include these goals, and as the days go by next week, I'll track my progress on achieving these goals.
