Today we finally got some exciting action in the markets. Way to start off the new year

I've gotten used to the idea of selling premium on big volatility spikes, but now, it's time to take it a step further. Instead of selling ICs, sell strangles first, and then, when volatility drops, buy the outer wings for really cheap. That's the next step. Wish I had done that, but it's ok. I still improved from last year by selling at least some premium (I would've been scared to before). I'll add this goal to the investments page. 

What was good: 

- sold premium despite the bearishness

What to improve on:

- should sell strangles, not ICs, on indices when IV is high (Can sell ICs on individual stocks), then buy the outer wings for very cheap when IV crushes to morph strangle into IC

Keep a close eye here on this section of the blog. I will try to be posting daily premarket updates.
