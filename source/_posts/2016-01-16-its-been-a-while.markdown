It has been a while since my last post, but it has also been a great start to 2016. I'll give brief updates here on each of the pillars, and more in detail with each deserving their own post.

**Health**

I was able to prepare meals to take to work most of the time, with the occasional cheat meal. I've noticed that my body fat has gone down just by look and feel. This is good, and I should press the advantage and keep going, instead of giving me more rope for slack. I need to stock up on lean meats again. I did a great job finishing them all.

In terms of my workouts, I seem to be plateauing in some exercises. Will revisit in specific blog post.

**Investments**

So far, I'm up on the year, but I could've been more positive on the year had it not been for the past two days of havoc. I overtraded and cost myself some premium I could've collected. Now, I'll need to wait god knows how long for premium to come in. Besides that, there better be some kind of a downmove, because I'm currently short some /ES futures, and any big rips to the upside will kill me directionally unless I sell premium from put options into it. More plans to come, and new goals to try to add to the list to tackle.

**Career**

It's been great so far. The team is friendly, and everyone gets along just fine. I'll be ramping up the Swift portion of our app. Many of the fundamental building blocks is already done. Soon, after the core features are built, I can begin to expand and lead.
