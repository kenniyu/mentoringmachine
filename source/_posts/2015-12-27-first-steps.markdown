Today I take the first steps in my weight training routine. Here are the results:

**Day A**

| Lift                                   | weight (lbs) | set 1 reps | set 2 reps | set 3 reps |
| ---------------------------------------|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Lat Pulldown                           | 140          | 7          | 4          | 3          |
| T Rows                                 | 70           | 7          | 5          | 5          |
| Behind the Back Barbell Shoulder Press | 125          | 7          | 3          | 2          |
| Dumbbell Shoulder Press                | 65           | 5          | 2          | 2          |
| Cable Lateral Shoulder Raise           | 7.5          | 10         | 6          | 5          |
| Rope Tricep Pushdown                   | 50           | 6          | 3          | 2          |
| Straight Bar Tricep Pushdown           | 25           | 7          | 5          | 5          | 

I swapped out some of the existing exercises for ones that did not have a crowd of people around. I'm assuming once I wake up early enough on the weekdays, I will not run into having to wait for equipment.

This is also posted on the [Health]({{ root_url }}/health "Health") page, which will be updated to reflect the most recent progress.

Weekly shopping items were bought last night, so I'm ready for the week. I need to meal prep at least 2 meals for the office tomorrow.

The coach says:

**Areas to improve: **

- drink more water throughout session
- meal prep earlier

**Good points: **

- took strict 30 second rest periods
- laser focus
- consistently tracked weights and reps

Now sleep.
