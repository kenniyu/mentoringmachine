    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a list of toxic trading assumptions, and ways to rethink the assumption as antidotes to improve my emotions:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Good Day is a Winning Day</p></blockquote>

<p>I should not determine a day as good/bad based on my P/L. A good day is one where I follow my trading rules, from execution to management. I should not be expecting to make profits every day. I should not expect to be happy if I have a profitable day, nor should I expect to be sad if I do not have a profitable day.</p>

<blockquote><p>Success Means Making a Living from Trading</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to assume this. People who are experts in other areas spend years becoming such. For example, a doctor spends at least 8 years in school before becoming an expert. Similarly, actors spend years (probably starting from a young age) before they&rsquo;re able to perform. It&rsquo;s more realistic to expect to keep my losses at a minimum and improve my trading process. Expecting to make a living from trading right off the bat will lead me to frustration and failure.</p>

<p><strong>So what are my expectations for my development over time?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To enter trades on pullbacks, and <em>wait</em> if necessary.</li>
<li>To sell premium when IV is high (above 50%)</li>
<li>To enter contrarian trades based off overbought/oversold stochastic indicators, and support/resistance levels</li>
<li>To not trade biotechs and FANG naked</li>
<li>To sell iron condors that collect about 1/3 the width of the strikes</li>
</ul>


<p>These are all challenging, but realistic and attainable. Success if measured by achieving these expectations consistently (and not jumping the gun because I feel like I will be missing out).</p>

<p>These will be on the investments page as well.</p>
