    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of the jumbotrons are getting crushed recently. I&rsquo;ll provide my analysis on some of these stocks.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_fb.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_fb.png" alt="FB" /></a></p>

<p>FB is trading well within the expanding cone pattern here. We&rsquo;ve sold off everything we&rsquo;ve gained from the earnings, and I&rsquo;m expecting a stall or bounce at the bottom of this cone. Put ratios could work out nicely, but I&rsquo;ll only put them on when we get closer, and if we don&rsquo;t consolidate at that bottom support. If that doesn&rsquo;t hold, we&rsquo;ll probably head towards the 85 level, but more importantly, we would probably head a lot lower. The measured move for a break out of this cone is about 20 points below the point of breakout from the cone.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon</strong></p>

<p>My <a href="/blog/2016/01/16/outlook-on-amzn/" title="post mid last month">post mid last month</a> when I wrote about my outlook on this stock was close to a perfect prediction. Here&rsquo;s the chart again, but on a daily timeframe:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_amzn.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_amzn.png" alt="AMZN" /></a></p>

<p>AMZN stalled at the 38% fib level before heading toward the 50% level, hovering and closing there today. Notice the Fib confluence level of 435. I expect the stock to head towards the area between 435 and 450 (Aug 2015 lows). From there, we&rsquo;ll probably get a bounce, as big as one that&rsquo;ll take us to 530 before we once again, head lower to the 400s level and below.</p>

<p><strong>Netflix</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_nflx.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_nflx.png" alt="NFLX" /></a></p>

<p>The 38% Fib level is working out quite nicely for NFLX. We&rsquo;ve closed the past two trading days around there. Because the overall market is not yet in an oversold condition, this leads me to believe that we will head lower soon to the 70 level (about the 50% fib level). However, if we do get a bounce, we could head back up to the 100 price level (which is about a 38% retracement from the recent all time high to the recent lows) before we start selling off again. I would be very surprised if the bounce we get in this stock is very weak. If so, carry that information forward, because that shows that the market itself is extremely weak.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_googl.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_googl.png" alt="GOOGL" /></a></p>

<p>GOOGL dropped hard last week, but it&rsquo;s starting this week with a bullish candlestick pattern. Let&rsquo;s monitor this for continuation and see if it can regain 705 as a support level. Otherwise, the next downside target is about 615.</p>

<p><strong>Priceline</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_pcln.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_pcln.png" alt="PCLN" /></a></p>

<p>PCLN is another jumbotron stock that dropped hard and completely just blew past the 1000 support level. Today, it closed about 30 points below that. This is one of the stocks that has me thinking that all the other stocks that are currently trading around their respective support level will not be able to hold. PCLN has a lot of room to fall, and the next target could easily be 800. The 38% fib retracement level from the 08 lows to the all time highs is about 920. We can see some consolidation/bounce from there, but the 50% (750) is more plausible given our momentum to the downside.</p>

<p><strong>Tesla</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_tsla.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_tsla.png" alt="TSLA" /></a></p>

<p>This is a chart that follows technical levels quite closely. TSLA recently broke 2 year support of about 180 and is currently headed towards the lower support level of 115. Coincidentally, the 180 and 115 support levels happen to also be the 38% and 61.8% fib level of TSLA lows to highs. This stock closed below the 50% fib level today, so this is also another one of those that may fall down further in the very near term.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_lnkd.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_lnkd.png" alt="LNKD" /></a></p>

<p>Wow. Sensational stock. LinkedIn broke multiple levels of long term support and is trading back in its IPO range. The closest level of resistance from here is the 124 level, which seems plausible via a dead cat bounce. From there, we&rsquo;ll probably test the lows at about $60. I would not mind buying some OOM put spreads, as long as the options are tight and liquid (they&rsquo;re probably not, though).</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_aapl.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_aapl.png" alt="AAPL" /></a></p>

<p>AAPL looks like it&rsquo;s due for a bounce. It is about to revisit the Aug 2015 lows, which acts as a long term support level as well. If that doesn&rsquo;t hold, we may see 85 soon. There is also a Head and Shoulders pattern, and the measured move from the neckline which is already present, is about 30 points. Thus, the stock could fall as far down as $75. A longer term bearish play would probably work better here, i.e. wide, OOM put spreads a few months out, scale in on any rallies.</p>

    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/02/07/weekly-market-outlook-02-slash-08-slash-16</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the market outlook for this upcoming week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll begin by looking at the broad market indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_in_balance.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_in_balance.png" alt="SPX" /></a></p>

<p>2 weeks ago, the market consolidated in the range shown by the blue lines, and subsequently broke out of that to the upside by approximately 50 points. Generally, that&rsquo;s a bullish signal (when we break out of balance with such a strong move, the expected movement is a continuation). However, not only did we stall there the next day, but over this past week, we fell back down. Just this past Friday, we broke back into that balance area and <em>closed</em> the trading day on the lows of that balance area. This spells to me a bearish tone in magnitude greater than the bullish one we had last Friday (when we broke out of balance). The reason is that, when we broke out of balance to the upside, we expected the move to continue that way, but as James Dalton said, if what we expect to happen doesn&rsquo;t happen, then we should expect a hard movement in the other direction.</p>

<p>Given all of that, I expect the SPX to continue its move downwards in the short term. I&rsquo;m not ruling out the possibility of any rallies from here on out, but I think the probabilities are small, and even if we do rally, it should be a small bounce before we soon continue lower.</p>

<p>So where can we go from here? Let&rsquo;s zoom out and take a look at the bigger picture on the weekly SPX chart:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_out_target.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_out_target.png" alt="SPX" /></a></p>

<p>Assuming bearish pressure continues, we should be headed towards the ascending trendline support. In the next couple of weeks, that would be around the 1750 to the 1800 level. A possible trade idea here is setting up a fly around the target area to capture that premium drain about two weeks out. I&rsquo;ve already set up a balanced fly expiring in February, 25 points wide, centered at 1760.</p>

<p>From that supporting trendline, we could see a bounce, so when we get there, I&rsquo;ll talk about the possible bounce plays. Until then, my target remains that trendline.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also take a look at other indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the weekly on the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-07_ndx_weekly.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-07_ndx_weekly.png" alt="NDX" /></a></p>

<p>Again, this spells bearish to me. We had two bullish hammers from 3 weeks ago, each of which insinuates a move higher, but instead, this past week, we erased all of that (buyer shutout) and closed even lower.</p>

<p>The same is true for the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly_2.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly_2.png" alt="RUT" /></a></p>

<p>Even clearer here, as it exhibits a prominent &ldquo;bear flag&rdquo; pattern.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-07_djx_weekly.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-07_djx_weekly.png" alt="DJX" /></a></p>

<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t appear quite as bearish as the other 3 indices, but with the majority of the indices all looking very bearish, it won&rsquo;t be long before this index follows them as well.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the weekly outlook, and even better if you take action. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2016-02-06T19:57:45-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/02/06/constantly-improving-myself</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this post earlier this month, but with things getting so busy at work, I couldn&rsquo;t find the time to until recently.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot has been different in the fronts of work and health. I&rsquo;ve been making steady progress in both of those aspects, and I&rsquo;ve been surprisingly consistent with waking up to work out in the mornings. I think this has helped bring me closer to the body shape that I want, but more can be done here. As for work, every day is an accomplishment of its own (establishing new features/frameworks in the Swift app and knocking out whatever needs to be done in the Obj-C side). However, most importantly, I wanted to review and strengthen the investment category, because I feel like this area is one that I can consciously train myself on to get better at, as it is one of the newer aspects.</p>

<p>A brief overview of January - great month, sold tons of premium and collected a huge amount. It must have been the volatility that allowed me to collect so much. One thing that did have me a bit worried was the last day of the month, however. A 50 point rally almost resulted in my having negative buying power in my account. Luckily, the bears took over this past week. Point here is, my size was in fact, too big for my own good. This is still something I need work on, and I&rsquo;ll need to take that down a notch. I haven&rsquo;t been going through a checklist before placing a trade, so I&rsquo;ll need to enforce that.</p>

<p>The first week of February is decent so far. Started just about the same way as it did for January. Every week, I&rsquo;m reviewing ST&rsquo;s videos on the market, and I&rsquo;m going to analyze the market myself as well and post them here. I&rsquo;ve also been looking at a book by James Dalton - <em>Markets in Profile - Profiting from the Auction Process</em>. Great read so far, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to applying the psychology and lessons of those in my trades going forward.</p>

<p>Last time, I also mentioned that one of my new goals is to add more directional trades. I have been, and they have been working out great, probably due to the volatility of this market. I also make sure to lock in profits when I get them. This has been a great way to keep my net liquidity up. I need to slowly increase size and not get overconfident to the point where my emotions come in and mess with my analysis. I&rsquo;ll need to stay fluid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with a post about where I think the market is headed next week, along with some trade ideas. This should be posted tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of weekly puts are expiring this week for me. That&rsquo;ll bring in a ton of theta, but one thing I&rsquo;ve been trying to do is to stay small. Any violent move to the upside or downside can dramatically wipe my account of profits gained from the previous week(s). With such a clean track record for the year so far, it&rsquo;ll be quite disappointing to see this happen.</p>

<p>According to the ST, when the market is sold so much like what we&rsquo;ve seen, we usually see a spike in volume, followed by a rally the following days. Interestingly, not that much volume traded today. This causes me to be a little doubtful of a rally tomorrow.</p>

<p>One of the things that I really like about ST is that they do directional plays, and they are really good at them. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone to accurate with their trades, so one of the goals that I have currently is to follow some of their trades. I heard a good advice today that will help me pull the trigger, and that is, simply do the trade, but put on a small size. Worry about size later, but focus on staying small and following the entries and exits according to plan. So instead of an outright buying/selling of 1 /ES contract, maybe trade 250 shares of the SPY. Also, perhaps try paper-trading the XEL-CMS pairs trade. For some of their trade ideas, they have unlimited risk on jumbotrons, which isn&rsquo;t my style. I can reduce risk by making the trade a limited risk and perhaps paying a slight debit for the trade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update the investments page to include these goals, and as the days go by next week, I&rsquo;ll track my progress on achieving these goals.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/staying-small/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-16T12:49:16-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/staying-small</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past week has been a huge tidal wave for my equity curve.</p>

<p>I got emotional after finding out that my OOM naked puts on /ES were getting closer to being ITM, sold an /ES to neutralize some deltas, only to find that the market would rip higher the next day. Then I neutralized more deltas by selling more puts (putting on more size), only to see the market drop huge the next day, forcing me to sell another /ES to neutralize more deltas, only to see the market close above my cost basis for /ES.</p>

<p>Obviously, the problem wasn&rsquo;t in neutralizing deltas. It was putting on too much size at the beginning. Instead of starting with many naked puts on the /ES (many as in more than I was comfortable with), I should&rsquo;ve kept it small, and probably should&rsquo;ve bought a more OOM put to reduce risk and lower buying power requirement.</p>

<p>It seems that I still have not learned. The goal of staying small has not yet been achieved. I will mark this as a top goal to achieve in my current investments goal page. I will keep this in check every day, before I place a trade.</p>

<p>Good luck to me next week. I should be good to the downside, and any upside will really bring in some premium.</p>
