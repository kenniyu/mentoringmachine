    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this post earlier this month, but with things getting so busy at work, I couldn&rsquo;t find the time to until recently.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot has been different in the fronts of work and health. I&rsquo;ve been making steady progress in both of those aspects, and I&rsquo;ve been surprisingly consistent with waking up to work out in the mornings. I think this has helped bring me closer to the body shape that I want, but more can be done here. As for work, every day is an accomplishment of its own (establishing new features/frameworks in the Swift app and knocking out whatever needs to be done in the Obj-C side). However, most importantly, I wanted to review and strengthen the investment category, because I feel like this area is one that I can consciously train myself on to get better at, as it is one of the newer aspects.</p>

<p>A brief overview of January - great month, sold tons of premium and collected a huge amount. It must have been the volatility that allowed me to collect so much. One thing that did have me a bit worried was the last day of the month, however. A 50 point rally almost resulted in my having negative buying power in my account. Luckily, the bears took over this past week. Point here is, my size was in fact, too big for my own good. This is still something I need work on, and I&rsquo;ll need to take that down a notch. I haven&rsquo;t been going through a checklist before placing a trade, so I&rsquo;ll need to enforce that.</p>

<p>The first week of February is decent so far. Started just about the same way as it did for January. Every week, I&rsquo;m reviewing ST&rsquo;s videos on the market, and I&rsquo;m going to analyze the market myself as well and post them here. I&rsquo;ve also been looking at a book by James Dalton - <em>Markets in Profile - Profiting from the Auction Process</em>. Great read so far, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to applying the psychology and lessons of those in my trades going forward.</p>

<p>Last time, I also mentioned that one of my new goals is to add more directional trades. I have been, and they have been working out great, probably due to the volatility of this market. I also make sure to lock in profits when I get them. This has been a great way to keep my net liquidity up. I need to slowly increase size and not get overconfident to the point where my emotions come in and mess with my analysis. I&rsquo;ll need to stay fluid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with a post about where I think the market is headed next week, along with some trade ideas. This should be posted tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since my last post, but it has also been a great start to 2016. I&rsquo;ll give brief updates here on each of the pillars, and more in detail with each deserving their own post.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong></p>

<p>I was able to prepare meals to take to work most of the time, with the occasional cheat meal. I&rsquo;ve noticed that my body fat has gone down just by look and feel. This is good, and I should press the advantage and use this to push me foward instead of giving me more rope for slack. I need to stock up on lean meats again. I did a great job finishing them all.</p>

<p>In terms of my workouts, I seem to be plateauing in some exercises. Will revisit in specific blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Investments</strong></p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m up on the year, but I could&rsquo;ve been more positive on the year had it not been for the past two days of havoc. I overtraded and cost myself some premium I could&rsquo;ve collected. Now, I&rsquo;ll need to wait god knows how long for premium to come in. Besides that, there better be some kind of a downmove, because I&rsquo;m currently short some /ES futures, and any big rips to the upside will kill me directionally unless I sell premium from put options into it. More plans to come, and new goals to try to add to the list to tackle.</p>

<p><strong>Career</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been great so far. The team is friendly, and everyone gets along just fine. I&rsquo;ll be ramping up the Swift portion of our app. Many of the fundamental building blocks is already done. Soon, after the core features are built, I can begin to expand and lead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was honestly a bit scared when I headed to the gym this morning, but it turned out that most of the people I saw there looked like gym veterans. All jacked and everything. My bad.</p>

<p>Well here was my performance this time around</p>

<td style="text-align:center;"> 7          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 5          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 5          </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Preacher Curls                         </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 80 (-5)     </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 7          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 6          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 4          </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Hammer Curls                           </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 35 (+5)     </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 7          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 4          </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 2          </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>So I took the preacher curls down 5 pounds, since the barbell was 80 pounds, not 85.</p>

<p>For exercises in which the weight changed, I did not bother calculating the delta.</p>

<p>Overall, not bad. I see some improvement.</p>

<p>Press the advantage. Keep it up.</p>

<p>One thing I want to do for my investments is to follow ShadowTrader&rsquo;s trade ideas more. I&rsquo;ll place a smaller size of them, so that when they do work out, well, at least I&rsquo;m not missing out.</p>

<p>Bulk prep tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s do this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night before I fell asleep, I looked at the time and thought to myself, &ldquo;there is no way that I would be able to wake up at 5 AM tomorrow.&rdquo; But I thought about the efforts I made so far, and frankly, it has not even been a week since I started this routine. Actually, I&rsquo;ve only woken up at 5 AM once, and that was two days ago when I first started the routine. To stop now? How sad. Sleep now.</p>

<p>Alarm rings 4:55. Cold air. Dry eyes. Suck it up. Drink water. Down shake. Hit the gym.</p>

<p>Complete Day A routine.</p>

<p>Feel good.</p>

<p>Now diet-wise. Need more tupperware. Let&rsquo;s do this next week.</p>

<p>What was good:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did not slip back into old habits. Got up and just hit the gym.</li>
</ul>


<p>What to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Watch the time and make sure I&rsquo;m planning ahead to sleep earlier.</li>
<li>Get some tupperware for food prep</li>
</ul>
