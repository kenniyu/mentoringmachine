<div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of the jumbotrons are getting crushed recently. I&rsquo;ll provide my analysis on some of these stocks.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_fb.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_fb.png" alt="FB" /></a></p>

<p>FB is trading well within the expanding cone pattern here. We&rsquo;ve sold off everything we&rsquo;ve gained from the earnings, and I&rsquo;m expecting a stall or bounce at the bottom of this cone. Put ratios could work out nicely, but I&rsquo;ll only put them on when we get closer, and if we don&rsquo;t consolidate at that bottom support. If that doesn&rsquo;t hold, we&rsquo;ll probably head towards the 85 level, but more importantly, we would probably head a lot lower. The measured move for a break out of this cone is about 20 points below the point of breakout from the cone.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon</strong></p>

<p>My <a href="/blog/2016/01/16/outlook-on-amzn/" title="post mid last month">post mid last month</a> when I wrote about my outlook on this stock was close to a perfect prediction. Here&rsquo;s the chart again, but on a daily timeframe:</p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_amzn.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_amzn.png" alt="AMZN" /></a></p>

<p>AMZN stalled at the 38% fib level before heading toward the 50% level, hovering and closing there today. Notice the Fib confluence level of 435. I expect the stock to head towards the area between 435 and 450 (Aug 2015 lows). From there, we&rsquo;ll probably get a bounce, as big as one that&rsquo;ll take us to 530 before we once again, head lower to the 400s level and below.</p>

<p><strong>Netflix</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_nflx.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_nflx.png" alt="NFLX" /></a></p>

<p>The 38% Fib level is working out quite nicely for NFLX. We&rsquo;ve closed the past two trading days around there. Because the overall market is not yet in an oversold condition, this leads me to believe that we will head lower soon to the 70 level (about the 50% fib level). However, if we do get a bounce, we could head back up to the 100 price level (which is about a 38% retracement from the recent all time high to the recent lows) before we start selling off again. I would be very surprised if the bounce we get in this stock is very weak. If so, carry that information forward, because that shows that the market itself is extremely weak.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_googl.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_googl.png" alt="GOOGL" /></a></p>

<p>GOOGL dropped hard last week, but it&rsquo;s starting this week with a bullish candlestick pattern. Let&rsquo;s monitor this for continuation and see if it can regain 705 as a support level. Otherwise, the next downside target is about 615.</p>

<p><strong>Priceline</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_pcln.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_pcln.png" alt="PCLN" /></a></p>

<p>PCLN is another jumbotron stock that dropped hard and completely just blew past the 1000 support level. Today, it closed about 30 points below that. This is one of the stocks that has me thinking that all the other stocks that are currently trading around their respective support level will not be able to hold. PCLN has a lot of room to fall, and the next target could easily be 800. The 38% fib retracement level from the 08 lows to the all time highs is about 920. We can see some consolidation/bounce from there, but the 50% (750) is more plausible given our momentum to the downside.</p>

<p><strong>Tesla</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_tsla.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_tsla.png" alt="TSLA" /></a></p>

<p>This is a chart that follows technical levels quite closely. TSLA recently broke 2 year support of about 180 and is currently headed towards the lower support level of 115. Coincidentally, the 180 and 115 support levels happen to also be the 38% and 61.8% fib level of TSLA lows to highs. This stock closed below the 50% fib level today, so this is also another one of those that may fall down further in the very near term.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_lnkd.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_lnkd.png" alt="LNKD" /></a></p>

<p>Wow. Sensational stock. LinkedIn broke multiple levels of long term support and is trading back in its IPO range. The closest level of resistance from here is the 124 level, which seems plausible via a dead cat bounce. From there, we&rsquo;ll probably test the lows at about $60. I would not mind buying some OOM put spreads, as long as the options are tight and liquid (they&rsquo;re probably not, though).</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_aapl.png"><img src="/images/investments/2016-02-08/2016-02-08_aapl.png" alt="AAPL" /></a></p>

<p>AAPL looks like it&rsquo;s due for a bounce. It is about to revisit the Aug 2015 lows, which acts as a long term support level as well. If that doesn&rsquo;t hold, we may see 85 soon. There is also a Head and Shoulders pattern, and the measured move from the neckline which is already present, is about 30 points. Thus, the stock could fall as far down as $75. A longer term bearish play would probably work better here, i.e. wide, OOM put spreads a few months out, scale in on any rallies.</p>
