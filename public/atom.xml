    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I think back to the Sophomore and Junior years of my college chapter, I realize that I was actually a natural at bodybuilding! And I&rsquo;m not talking about my genes, because if it were truly my genes that helped me with bodybuilding, I wouldn&rsquo;t even by writing this post right now. No, I&rsquo;m talking about my habits surrounding bodybuilding.</p>

<p>What happened? I used to be so consistent with waking up in the morning, downing that protein shake, hitting the gym around 8am before my classes started, coming back home to drink another protein shake, eating steak and rice for the following meal, and then eating chicken breast and cooked oats every 2.5 hours until bedtime. Not only that, but I would incorporate HIIT into my lifestyle every other day to maintain mostly lean mass. Currently, all of this sounds painful (buying food, preparing meals, waking up early), but back then, it certainly did not feel that way at all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I felt like my weight training routine was a breeze to finish. I was so consistent with everything, making sure I maintained and progressed (lifting heavier weights over time). I never felt like deadlifts and leg workouts were a pain. Now? I skip them like a pansy-ass bitch. I have stopped tracking my repetitions, and the slightest sense of a setback ruins my mood for the rest of my workout that I barely even try anymore.</p>

<p>Obviously, this has become a problem. I vaguely remember the rewarding feeling that I get when I challenge myself to push for that last rep, to sprint to the top of the hill before the timer beeps for the next round of my HIIT session. I feel like if I continue down this path, not only will I foster laziness in my life, but also I will not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle as I grow older. I <em>need</em> to change in order to feel healthy, and I <em>need</em> to change to feel absolutely rewarded.</p>

<p>Psychologically, there is some work that needs to be done. I&rsquo;ll start by listing specific actions (behaviors) that I can take to achieve the change that I want. Broadly speaking, the change that I want is to get back into the body shape I had back in college. Specifically, regarding my training, here are the broken down behavioral changes necessary to achieve my goal, listed in order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation Before Every Lifting Session</li>
<li>Record Progress During Every Lift Session</li>
</ol>


<p>And, regarding my diet, here are the broken down behavioral changes necessary to achieve my goal, also listed in order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy Weekly Food Items</li>
<li>Prepare Weekly Meals</li>
<li>Eliminate Sweet Drinks. Drink Water Instead</li>
</ol>


<p>For both of these tasks, I must look one week ahead to plan for any potential obstacles (vacations, events) which may interfere with my accomplishing the behavioral change. Over time, by repeating a behavior correctly, I can successfully engrain it into my arsenal of healthy habits. Then, and only then, can I move on to the next behavior.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>I will focus on the top behaviors of both the fitness category and the diet category. Here is the detailed plan for tackling each behavior:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><span style="color:#e7d0ba"><strong>Preparation Before Every Lifting Session</strong></span></p>

<p>This means I will mentally prepare myself for the upcoming day&rsquo;s routine by thinking about the exercises that I will be performing. This also means I will physically be preparing myself for the session by logging the exercises on my phone (pre-set with expected weights and reps), sleeping at an early enough time, eating and staying hydrated before my workout.</p>

<p><span style="color:#e7d0ba"><strong>Buy Weekly Food Items</strong></span></p>

<p>Muscles aren&rsquo;t made in the gym - they&rsquo;re made in the kitchen. Without proper nutrition, I won&rsquo;t be able to see progress in the gym. But without food in the house, I won&rsquo;t be able to get the necessary nutrients. I need to stock the fridge with oatmeal, chicken breast, and onions at the very least. This weekend, I will need to go food shopping to prepare for the upcoming week.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Tomorrow I will update my progress on these 2 action items.</p>
