    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the market outlook for this upcoming week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll begin by looking at the broad market indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_in_balance.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_in_balance.png" alt="SPX" /></a></p>

<p>2 weeks ago, the market consolidated in the range shown by the blue lines, and subsequently broke out of that to the upside by approximately 50 points. Generally, that&rsquo;s a bullish signal (when we break out of balance with such a strong move, the expected movement is a continuation). However, not only did we stall there the next day, but over this past week, we fell back down. Just this past Friday, we broke back into that balance area and <em>closed</em> the trading day on the lows of that balance area. This spells to me a bearish tone in magnitude greater than the bullish one we had last Friday (when we broke out of balance). The reason is that, when we broke out of balance to the upside, we expected the move to continue that way, but as James Dalton said, if what we expect to happen doesn&rsquo;t happen, then we should expect a hard movement in the other direction.</p>

<p>Given all of that, I expect the SPX to continue its move downwards in the short term. I&rsquo;m not ruling out the possibility of any rallies from here on out, but I think the probabilities are small, and even if we do rally, it should be a small bounce before we soon continue lower.</p>

<p>So where can we go from here? Let&rsquo;s zoom out and take a look at the bigger picture on the weekly SPX chart:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_out_target.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_spx_zoomed_out_target.png" alt="SPX" /></a></p>

<p>Assuming bearish pressure continues, we should be headed towards the ascending trendline support. In the next couple of weeks, that would be around the 1750 to the 1800 level. A possible trade idea here is setting up a fly around the target area to capture that premium drain about two weeks out. I&rsquo;ve already set up a balanced fly expiring in February, 25 points wide, centered at 1760.</p>

<p>From that supporting trendline, we could see a bounce, so when we get there, I&rsquo;ll talk about the possible bounce plays. Until then, my target remains that trendline.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also take a look at other indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the weekly on the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_ndx_weekly.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_ndx_weekly.png" alt="NDX" /></a></p>

<p>Again, this spells bearish to me. We had two bullish hammers from 3 weeks ago, each of which insinuates a move higher, but instead, this past week, we erased all of that (buyer shutout) and closed even lower.</p>

<p>The same is true for the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_rut_weekly.png" alt="RUT" /></a></p>

<p>Even clearer here, as it exhibits a prominent &ldquo;bear flag&rdquo; pattern.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_djx_weekly.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-02-07_djx_weekly.png" alt="DJX" /></a></p>

<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t appear quite as bearish as the other 3 indices, but with the majority of the indices all looking very bearish, it won&rsquo;t be long before this index follows them as well.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the weekly outlook, and even better if you take action. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2016-02-06T19:57:45-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/02/06/constantly-improving-myself</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this post earlier this month, but with things getting so busy at work, I couldn&rsquo;t find the time to until recently.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot has been different in the fronts of work and health. I&rsquo;ve been making steady progress in both of those aspects, and I&rsquo;ve been surprisingly consistent with waking up to work out in the mornings. I think this has helped bring me closer to the body shape that I want, but more can be done here. As for work, every day is an accomplishment of its own (establishing new features/frameworks in the Swift app and knocking out whatever needs to be done in the Obj-C side). However, most importantly, I wanted to review and strengthen the investment category, because I feel like this area is one that I can consciously train myself on to get better at, as it is one of the newer aspects.</p>

<p>A brief overview of January - great month, sold tons of premium and collected a huge amount. It must have been the volatility that allowed me to collect so much. One thing that did have me a bit worried was the last day of the month, however. A 50 point rally almost resulted in my having negative buying power in my account. Luckily, the bears took over this past week. Point here is, my size was in fact, too big for my own good. This is still something I need work on, and I&rsquo;ll need to take that down a notch. I haven&rsquo;t been going through a checklist before placing a trade, so I&rsquo;ll need to enforce that.</p>

<p>The first week of February is decent so far. Started just about the same way as it did for January. Every week, I&rsquo;m reviewing ST&rsquo;s videos on the market, and I&rsquo;m going to analyze the market myself as well and post them here. I&rsquo;ve also been looking at a book by James Dalton - <em>Markets in Profile - Profiting from the Auction Process</em>. Great read so far, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to applying the psychology and lessons of those in my trades going forward.</p>

<p>Last time, I also mentioned that one of my new goals is to add more directional trades. I have been, and they have been working out great, probably due to the volatility of this market. I also make sure to lock in profits when I get them. This has been a great way to keep my net liquidity up. I need to slowly increase size and not get overconfident to the point where my emotions come in and mess with my analysis. I&rsquo;ll need to stay fluid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with a post about where I think the market is headed next week, along with some trade ideas. This should be posted tomorrow.</p>

    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/21/reviewing-and-adding-investment-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of weekly puts are expiring this week for me. That&rsquo;ll bring in a ton of theta, but one thing I&rsquo;ve been trying to do is to stay small. Any violent move to the upside or downside can dramatically wipe my account of profits gained from the previous week(s). With such a clean track record for the year so far, it&rsquo;ll be quite disappointing to see this happen.</p>

<p>According to the ST, when the market is sold so much like what we&rsquo;ve seen, we usually see a spike in volume, followed by a rally the following days. Interestingly, not that much volume traded today. This causes me to be a little doubtful of a rally tomorrow.</p>

<p>One of the things that I really like about ST is that they do directional plays, and they are really good at them. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone to accurate with their trades, so one of the goals that I have currently is to follow some of their trades. I heard a good advice today that will help me pull the trigger, and that is, simply do the trade, but put on a small size. Worry about size later, but focus on staying small and following the entries and exits according to plan. So instead of an outright buying/selling of 1 /ES contract, maybe trade 250 shares of the SPY. Also, perhaps try paper-trading the XEL-CMS pairs trade. For some of their trade ideas, they have unlimited risk on jumbotrons, which isn&rsquo;t my style. I can reduce risk by making the trade a limited risk and perhaps paying a slight debit for the trade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update the investments page to include these goals, and as the days go by next week, I&rsquo;ll track my progress on achieving these goals.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/staying-small/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-16T12:49:16-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/staying-small</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past week has been a huge tidal wave for my equity curve.</p>

<p>I got emotional after finding out that my OOM naked puts on /ES were getting closer to being ITM, sold an /ES to neutralize some deltas, only to find that the market would rip higher the next day. Then I neutralized more deltas by selling more puts (putting on more size), only to see the market drop huge the next day, forcing me to sell another /ES to neutralize more deltas, only to see the market close above my cost basis for /ES.</p>

<p>Obviously, the problem wasn&rsquo;t in neutralizing deltas. It was putting on too much size at the beginning. Instead of starting with many naked puts on the /ES (many as in more than I was comfortable with), I should&rsquo;ve kept it small, and probably should&rsquo;ve bought a more OOM put to reduce risk and lower buying power requirement.</p>

<p>It seems that I still have not learned. The goal of staying small has not yet been achieved. I will mark this as a top goal to achieve in my current investments goal page. I will keep this in check every day, before I place a trade.</p>

<p>Good luck to me next week. I should be good to the downside, and any upside will really bring in some premium.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/outlook-on-amzn/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-16T12:04:24-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/outlook-on-amzn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a long term look on AMZN:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-16_amzn_long_term.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-16_amzn_long_term.png" alt="AMZN - Long Term" /></a></p>

<p>Since 2009, AMZN has climbed a long way. Regardless of how ridiculous this is, we can&rsquo;t fight price action - it is what it is. But we can look for opportunities.</p>

<p>Notice the first Fibonacci levels drawn from the 2009 lows to the current highs, and also notice the second Fib levels drawn from the 2014 lows to the current highs. You&rsquo;ll notice that these levels coincide at around 435 (both the 38% from the first Fib and the 61.8% from the second). We can use Fib confluence to help guide us as to where price may trade over the next few months.</p>

<p>From this chart, it appears that 435 is a possible target level. If the market continues to be bearish, and we break below the rough ascending expanding cone pattern shown by the yellow trendlines, expect 435 to come into play.</p>

<p>Other possible downside support levels include the 50% Fib level (of the second fib retracement drawn), followed by the 400.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the recent price action in AMZN over the past year:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-16_amzn_short_term.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-16_amzn_short_term.png" alt="AMZN - Long Term" /></a></p>

<p>In the shorter time frame (next couple of weeks), keep a close eye on AMZN as we may see a bounce. Current market stochastics signal an oversold condition (although we&rsquo;ve been oversold since last week). If we do bounce, and we bounce hard, look for a break above 580 (resistance level from the previous quarter). A break above 580 will cause some short-covering. First target should be 595 (support level of the recent quarter), followed by 630 (intermediate support/resistance level of recent quarter).</p>

<p>Do note that AMZN reports earnings on 1/28 after the market closes. If you plan on avoiding big binary events, stay on options that expire before then.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/its-been-a-while/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-16T00:24:08-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/16/its-been-a-while</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since my last post, but it has also been a great start to 2016. I&rsquo;ll give brief updates here on each of the pillars, and more in detail with each deserving their own post.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong></p>

<p>I was able to prepare meals to take to work most of the time, with the occasional cheat meal. I&rsquo;ve noticed that my body fat has gone down just by look and feel. This is good, and I should press the advantage and use this to push me foward instead of giving me more rope for slack. I need to stock up on lean meats again. I did a great job finishing them all.</p>

<p>In terms of my workouts, I seem to be plateauing in some exercises. Will revisit in specific blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Investments</strong></p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m up on the year, but I could&rsquo;ve been more positive on the year had it not been for the past two days of havoc. I overtraded and cost myself some premium I could&rsquo;ve collected. Now, I&rsquo;ll need to wait god knows how long for premium to come in. Besides that, there better be some kind of a downmove, because I&rsquo;m currently short some /ES futures, and any big rips to the upside will kill me directionally unless I sell premium from put options into it. More plans to come, and new goals to try to add to the list to tackle.</p>

<p><strong>Career</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been great so far. The team is friendly, and everyone gets along just fine. I&rsquo;ll be ramping up the Swift portion of our app. Many of the fundamental building blocks is already done. Soon, after the core features are built, I can begin to expand and lead.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/04/catching-e-coli/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-04T22:45:30-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/04/catching-e-coli</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have titled the post this way. Anyway, let&rsquo;s take a look at CMG.</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-04_cmg_weekly.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-04_cmg_weekly.png" alt="Catching E. Coli" /></a></p>

<p>Over the past 3 months, CMG has fallen around 40%. Stochastics are screaming the oversold signal (though CMG can still fall further). Note the ascending trendline support going back to 2009. This has acted as a solid support since then, and we can attempt to play CMG for a bounce at around the 400 level.</p>

<p>For those that like to front-run the trade though, you may also target the 433 level, as that is a 61.8% Fib level, with the retracement starting from 2012 lows.</p>

<p>In general, according to technical patterns, it is highly probable that the area from 400 to 433 will act as some level of support or consolidation area.</p>

<p>With the increase in volatility, we can look to the options market to place a trade in hopes for a bounce, as the premium in CMG is slightly inflated.</p>

<p>Please examine the following trade idea:</p>

<p><a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-04_cmg_weekly_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://mentoringmachine.com/images/investments/2016-01-04_cmg_weekly_risk_graph.png" alt="Potential trade idea" /></a></p>

<p>Here, we buy 1 400 PUT while financing that by selling 2 375 PUTs, for a total of 0.36 credit. Our breakeven for this trade is around 349. If CMG trades above this price by the 5th Friday of January, we are profitable. This trade has a 99.72% probability of profit, has a maximum loss of $34,964, and a potential maximum profit of $2536.00. For those that do not like the big downside risk, you can also buy a more OOM put, and potentially pay 0 for this trade.</p>

<p>Do note that CMG reports earnings on Feb 2, so to lessen the likelihood of being run over by a binary event, aim to trade options that expire before that date (unless you do want to play the earnings).</p>

    <updated>2016-01-04T22:33:25-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2016/01/04/welcome-the-2016-stock-market</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we finally got some exciting action in the markets. Way to start off the new year</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the idea of selling premium on big volatility spikes, but now, it&rsquo;s time to take it a step further. Instead of selling ICs, sell strangles first, and then, when volatility drops, buy the outer wings for really cheap. That&rsquo;s the next step. Wish I had done that, but it&rsquo;s ok. I still improved from last year by selling at least some premium (I would&rsquo;ve been scared to before). I&rsquo;ll add this goal to the investments page.</p>

<p>What was good:</p>

<ul>
<li>sold premium despite the bearishness</li>
</ul>


<p>What to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>should sell strangles, not ICs, on indices when IV is high (Can sell ICs on individual stocks), then buy the outer wings for very cheap when IV crushes to morph strangle into IC</li>
</ul>


<p>Keep a close eye here on this section of the blog. I will try to be posting daily premarket updates.</p>

<p>So I took the preacher curls down 5 pounds, since the barbell was 80 pounds, not 85.</p>

<p>For exercises in which the weight changed, I did not bother calculating the delta.</p>

<p>Overall, not bad. I see some improvement.</p>

<p>Press the advantage. Keep it up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night before I fell asleep, I looked at the time and thought to myself, &ldquo;there is no way that I would be able to wake up at 5 AM tomorrow.&rdquo; But I thought about the efforts I made so far, and frankly, it has not even been a week since I started this routine. Actually, I&rsquo;ve only woken up at 5 AM once, and that was two days ago when I first started the routine. To stop now? How sad. Sleep now.</p>

<p>Alarm rings 4:55. Cold air. Dry eyes. Suck it up. Drink water. Down shake. Hit the gym.</p>

<p>Complete Day A routine.</p>

<p>Feel good.</p>

<p>Now diet-wise. Need more tupperware. Let&rsquo;s do this next week.</p>

<p>What was good:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did not slip back into old habits. Got up and just hit the gym.</li>
</ul>


<p>What to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Watch the time and make sure I&rsquo;m planning ahead to sleep earlier.</li>
<li>Get some tupperware for food prep</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I honestly did not even place a new trade. My hands were in my pockets the entire time.</p>

<p>An exit order did fill, it was for the DIA IC, exited at 50% of max profit. Good. These GTC orders are getting filled effortlessly.</p>

<p>Was today a profitable day? No. Did I feel good about my trades? Yes, because I did not place any. I&rsquo;ve already sold some OOM calls on this overbought stochastic reading, and, because I&rsquo;m not going to add more negative deltas, I&rsquo;m just going to sit and wait for the next drop. At that point, I&rsquo;ll probably lower my delta exposure. For now, not much I can do anyway. I won&rsquo;t even sell puts to flatten those deltas because it&rsquo;s not worth it in a low IV environment.</p>

<p>My honest opinion? Today&rsquo;s rally was the <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-29/herd-heading-cliff" title="idiots' rally">idiots' rally</a> of the week. Just saying.</p>

<p>My chest needs more improvement, but there are a couple of factors affecting the target miss, such as the time of the day of the workout, and the fact that I haven&rsquo;t worked my chest since a week ago. Consistency will bring more accurate readings over time. For now, this is a start.</p>

<p>What was good:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintained good focus</li>
<li>ensured strict rest periods</li>
</ul>


<p>What to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>taking a set to failure (legs, biceps)</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I started my first day at Stellar. I would say I made decent progress so far - I thought it would take me a bit longer to get the codebase up and running, but I already have the environment setup and am already beginning to take a look at the code that I&rsquo;ll be working with. Score. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll dive deeper into the code, and will be recording what I find in a doc.</p>

<p>On the health side, today was an &ldquo;off day,&rdquo; meaning no working out. For about the first month, no cardio with be incorporated into my fitness routines. This is just for me to retain the new behavioral changes more easily. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be waking up early to hit the gym, so I&rsquo;ll need to review my plan later tonight and mentally prepare as well. As for tonight, I&rsquo;ll be eating the food I had cooked yesterday.</p>

<p>On the investments front, not much happened today. I opened up an IC today on IWM, since it currently showed the highest IV rank out of the DIA, QQQ, IWM, and SPY. A trade was closed in P for a 50% profit, so I&rsquo;ll take that. Other than that, no opening trades today, which is nice. On a low volume day, and not much IV increase, I&rsquo;ll sit on my hands. We&rsquo;ll see how the market behaves tomorrow, but I do not expect volume to pick up either, nor any major market movement to occur, so I&rsquo;ll probably be sitting on my hands again.</p>

<p>I swapped out some of the existing exercises for ones that did not have a crowd of people around. I&rsquo;m assuming once I wake up early enough on the weekdays, I will not run into having to wait for equipment.</p>

<p>This is also posted on the <a href="http://mentoringmachine.com/health" title="Health">Health</a> page, which will be updated to reflect the most recent progress.</p>

<p>Weekly shopping items were bought last night, so I&rsquo;m ready for the week. I need to meal prep at least 2 meals for the office tomorrow.</p>

<p>The coach says:</p>

<p><strong>Areas to improve: </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>drink more water throughout session</li>
<li>meal prep earlier</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Good points: </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>took strict 30 second rest periods</li>
<li>laser focus</li>
<li>consistently tracked weights and reps</li>
</ul>


<p>Now sleep.</p>

    <link href="http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2015/12/26/toxic-trading-assumptions-and-antidotes/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-26T18:18:41-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mentoringmachine.com/blog/2015/12/26/toxic-trading-assumptions-and-antidotes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a list of toxic trading assumptions, and ways to rethink the assumption as antidotes to improve my emotions:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Good Day is a Winning Day</p></blockquote>

<p>I should not determine a day as good/bad based on my P/L. A good day is one where I follow my trading rules, from execution to management. I should not be expecting to make profits every day. I should not expect to be happy if I have a profitable day, nor should I expect to be sad if I do not have a profitable day.</p>

<blockquote><p>Success Means Making a Living from Trading</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to assume this. People who are experts in other areas spend years becoming such. For example, a doctor spends at least 8 years in school before becoming an expert. Similarly, actors spend years (probably starting from a young age) before they&rsquo;re able to perform. It&rsquo;s more realistic to expect to keep my losses at a minimum and improve my trading process. Expecting to make a living from trading right off the bat will lead me to frustration and failure.</p>

<p><strong>So what are my expectations for my development over time?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To enter trades on pullbacks, and <em>wait</em> if necessary.</li>
<li>To sell premium when IV is high (above 50%)</li>
<li>To enter contrarian trades based off overbought/oversold stochastic indicators, and support/resistance levels</li>
<li>To not trade biotechs and FANG naked</li>
<li>To sell iron condors that collect about 1/3 the width of the strikes</li>
</ul>


<p>These are all challenging, but realistic and attainable. Success if measured by achieving these expectations consistently (and not jumping the gun because I feel like I will be missing out).</p>

<p>These will be on the investments page as well.</p>

<p>Every other day, I will choose one routine out of the 3 to perform. How I choose them is determined by the following pattern: <strong>A-B-A-C-A-B-A-C-A-B-A-C</strong> etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Monday, I start with A.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I think back to the Sophomore and Junior years of my college chapter, I realize that I was actually a natural at bodybuilding! And I&rsquo;m not talking about my genes, because if it were truly my genes that helped me with bodybuilding, I wouldn&rsquo;t even by writing this post right now. No, I&rsquo;m talking about my habits surrounding bodybuilding.</p>

<p>What happened? I used to be so consistent with waking up in the morning, downing that protein shake, hitting the gym around 8am before my classes started, coming back home to drink another protein shake, eating steak and rice for the following meal, and then eating chicken breast and cooked oats every 2.5 hours until bedtime. Not only that, but I would incorporate HIIT into my lifestyle every other day to maintain mostly lean mass. Currently, all of this sounds painful (buying food, preparing meals, waking up early), but back then, it certainly did not feel that way at all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I felt like my weight training routine was a breeze to finish. I was so consistent with everything, making sure I maintained and progressed (lifting heavier weights over time). I never felt like deadlifts and leg workouts were a pain. Now? I skip them like a pansy-ass bitch. I have stopped tracking my repetitions, and the slightest sense of a setback ruins my mood for the rest of my workout that I barely even try anymore.</p>

<p>Obviously, this has become a problem. I vaguely remember the rewarding feeling that I get when I challenge myself to push for that last rep, to sprint to the top of the hill before the timer beeps for the next round of my HIIT session. I feel like if I continue down this path, not only will I foster laziness in my life, but also I will not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle as I grow older. I <em>need</em> to change in order to feel healthy, and I <em>need</em> to change to feel absolutely rewarded.</p>

<p>Psychologically, there is some work that needs to be done. I&rsquo;ll start by listing specific actions (behaviors) that I can take to achieve the change that I want. Broadly speaking, the change that I want is to get back into the body shape I had back in college. Specifically, regarding my training, here are the broken down behavioral changes necessary to achieve my goal, listed in order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation Before Every Lifting Session</li>
<li>Record Progress During Every Lift Session</li>
</ol>


<p>And, regarding my diet, here are the broken down behavioral changes necessary to achieve my goal, also listed in order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy Weekly Food Items</li>
<li>Prepare Weekly Meals</li>
<li>Eliminate Sweet Drinks. Drink Water Instead</li>
</ol>


<p>For both of these tasks, I must look one week ahead to plan for any potential obstacles (vacations, events) which may interfere with my accomplishing the behavioral change. Over time, by repeating a behavior correctly, I can successfully engrain it into my arsenal of healthy habits. Then, and only then, can I move on to the next behavior.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>I will focus on the top behaviors of both the fitness category and the diet category. Here is the detailed plan for tackling each behavior:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><span style="color:#e7d0ba"><strong>Preparation Before Every Lifting Session</strong></span></p>

<p>This means I will mentally prepare myself for the upcoming day&rsquo;s routine by thinking about the exercises that I will be performing. This also means I will physically be preparing myself for the session by logging the exercises on my phone (pre-set with expected weights and reps), sleeping at an early enough time, eating and staying hydrated before my workout.</p>

<p><span style="color:#e7d0ba"><strong>Buy Weekly Food Items</strong></span></p>

<p>Muscles aren&rsquo;t made in the gym - they&rsquo;re made in the kitchen. Without proper nutrition, I won&rsquo;t be able to see progress in the gym. But without food in the house, I won&rsquo;t be able to get the necessary nutrients. I need to stock the fridge with oatmeal, chicken breast, and onions at the very least. This weekend, I will need to go food shopping to prepare for the upcoming week.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Tomorrow I will update my progress on these 2 action items.</p>
